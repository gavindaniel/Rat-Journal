						My name is Gavin Daniel, and I grew up in a black hole. </br></br></br>
						That black hole, is called Wenatchee, Washington. </br></br>
						Ever since I was a kid, I had one of the biggest imaginations.</br>
						I could waste away hours, days, weeks, in my own bedroom. </br>
						Once I closed my door, I was in my own world. </br>
						What I soon realized was, I wanted to share that world with more people than just myself. </br>
						For years, I have tried to carry that same dedication and commitment to my imaginary world over to the real world. </br>
						I day-dreamed of imaginary worlds where my friends and I's lives revolved around what we loved at the time: </br>
						Legos,</br>
						Beanie Babies,</br>
						Building Forts,</br>
						Video Games,</br>
						Anything. </br>
						Yet, I never understood why no one ever shared the same interest, or maintained the same level of interest. </br>
						Sooner or later, people discovered new interests, new games would be released,</br>
						and all that progress would feel like for nothing...
					</br></br></br>

						It wasn't until May of 2017, when talking with my good friend Kevin...</br>
						that I finally figured it out.</br>
						Kevin has been the only person in my 21 years </br>
						that I have found to have a similar level of imagination, and
						dedication to the things he loves (video games). </br>
						</br>
						Kevin and I were talking about the very few things to do
						in our beloved hometown. </br>
						We were listing off things to do when we got to Dragon's Lair at Eastmont Lanes.</br>
						My first idea to Kevin was what if there was a futuristic Arcade...</br>
						Where kids (even still at heart like Kevin and I)</br>
						could go and play ALL the games from today back to Pong. </br>
						That's when the lightbulb went off in my head...
					</br></br>

						What if... </br>
						There was a place where Kids could let there imaginations run wild...</br>
						Where the walls were your canvas...</br>
						and two dozens TVs lined the walls ready to have Nintendo 64s and Xbox Ones plugged in and played.</br>
						A place where kids begged their parents to let them stay "just one more hour" because they're having too much fun right now.</br>
						A place where parents regain the tranquility of their homes, and re-learn the meaning to un-wind after a long days work.</br>
						A place where the workers are more excited to come everyday than the Kids.</br>
						A place where time is mearly a measurement how much fun you're having. </br>
					</br></br></br>
						We're not a Day Care.</br>
						Or a place to drop your trouble-some kids off of and hope they get tired out.</br>
						</br>
						We're not a School. </br>
						And we're not going to force your kid to do anything they don't want to (other than follow our rules of safety).</br>
						</br></br></br>
						We're a place to let your kid discover the Right-side of their Brain.</br>
						A place to show them how cool learning is.</br>
						Experience new things, and connect the dots.</br>
						</br></br>
						All by their own choice.
